# homebrew-qt4

This Homebrew tap allows you to install Qt4 on macOS Sierra. You can install it like this:

    brew install cartr/qt4/qt

The installation may take a little while, since Qt4 will be recompiled from source.

Feel free to submit an issue or pull request if you run into any problems or have any suggestions for improvements to the package.
